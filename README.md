# levenshtein
Calculate the Levenshtein Distance (LD) between two strings.

            The LD is the minimum numbers of edits (insert, delete, or
            substitute) to transform one string into another.
            The code calculates the LD and the minimum cost path (MCP)
            through the LD matrix.  The MCP dictates the step-by-step
            edits to make the transformation.  The code also shows the
            transformation of the source string into the target.

Caveat:  I am learning Python, so this implementation is likely very
inefficient!
